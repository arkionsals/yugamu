Grind only the same
Plaid please keep a net
Night slide sobs

While beating the wall
Black out
Where the nerve is paralyze
De slash

La shout
Mite dark
In the ditch
Is death
Clash back
Nancy infant stage
Dance dance dance

Trash out
Trash out
Decay of a nova</pre></div>

Jumping out! Tuning in to the sky! Now
Jamming out! Strong Changing it! The Future

Jumping in! To the Sea Tuning out! Now
Jamming in! Strong Clap your hands! To the Future
I can go on a step, for my dreams, for your dreams
I can go on a jive, for my dreams, for your dreams
Now, it leaves it to me
I can go deep glide, for my lust, for your lust
Now, it leaves it to me
I can go deep dive, For my lust for you
I just wanna be dramatic life at all the time and with you
Now, it leaves it to me
I can go deep glide, for our destiny

Driving on! Always Bringing off! Don't hesitate
Driving on! And Carry it off! Believing on! At times Breezing on! Look on
Drifting off! And Clap your hands! To the light
I can go on a step, for my dreams, for your dreams
I can go on a jive, for my dreams, for your dreams
Now, it leaves it to me
I can go deep glide, for my lust, for your lust
Now, it leaves it to me
I can go deep glide, for my lust, for your lust
Now, It leaves it to me
I can go deep dive, for my lust for you
I just wanna be dramatic life at all the time and with you
Now, it leaves it to me
I can go deep glide, for our destiny</pre></div>

      <div class="lyrics"><pre>Lyrics (English Translation):
        
Lived in buried memory
With fear-ridden self-consciousness
I'm just a lone prayer

Keep running on the cold track
The hate crazed thoughts just don't stop
As if a dream awake from the dark
The world deletes all I said to you

Overwrite this pain tearing me apart
Melting
Frozen mind
Ray of light
Ready for a trip to nowhere

Overwrite this pain tearing me apart
I'm at ease
My last pray with no aim
My last... let me feel alive </pre></div>

      <div class="lyrics"><pre>Lyrics (English Translation):
        
Hey, do you know?
What appears in our eyes is dreams and illusions.
Under the grey sky, I walk, searching for you.
The words you spun, the past that was closed off –
What I hear is the sound of a single footstep.


(falling rain) The forest of destiny
(tears for you) Is a deeply sleeping memory.
The spiderweb threads are softly connected.
Before they’re reeled in,
I wonder if I’ll be able to see a gentle light.

Hey, do you know?
What echoes in my chest is the beat of the dark night.
I was listening carefully to the sound
Of the waves that approach and go back.

You who looked down, your whispered voice –
What will disappear is a fleeting wish.

(falling rain) The rainbow in the open sky
(tears for you) Is a legend that goes on forever.
The scent of flowers disappears in the rain.
I wonder if the day will come
When I accept a fate soaked in loneliness.

(falling rain) The forest of destiny
(tears for you) Is a deeply sleeping memory.
The spiderweb threads are softly connected.
Before they’re reeled in,
I wonder if I’ll be able to see a gentle light. </pre></div>

A mirage from the distance at dusk
I want to see you, I want to see you
I can't see you, I can't see you
Your Utopia
        
If we can meet in this place someday
I miss you, I miss you
I need you, I need you
Sexy, sexy
        
Hey? Why don't you come to my room?
I'll tell you a secret story
        
If you can't get going tonight
Even if I take away, there's nothing I can do
        
My heart was also wet on this dishonest night
Time cannot be turned back
Come back, come back, come back
        
A mirage from the far reaches of passion
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it
Feel-good paradise
        
If we could meet in that burning place
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it
Sexy, sexy dance
        
The stars turn pale and the flowers are in disarray
It shines brightly from the darkness
        
A mirage entangled in my fingertips
Teasing, teasing
Teasing, teasing
Let it simmer
        
I'll always be in love around here
I miss you, I miss you
I need you, I need you
Sexy, sexy you
        
Oh baby, my baby
Oh baby, oh baby
Your Utopia
        
Beyond the passion is a mirage
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it
Many times
        
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it
Sparkling
Sexy, sexy
