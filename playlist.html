      <div class="lyrics"><pre>Lyrics (English Translation):
        
When I pushed my hand into the darkness ”the past” faintly swayed
Like a spider’s thread[,] memories softly creep up on me

The thread pulls me in and entwines my memories

A sweet fragrance is scattered about
Trembling butterflies in a spider’s web pile up beyond the mirror

Wanting to see you
In the darkness my hand vainly reaches out into emptiness
It the night it fades away

Unable to see you
My fragile wish gets caught in my web of memories
I can no longer breathe

A rose colored apparition sings in the depths of my dream
And laughs a soft beckoning laugh

I wake up with my dream leaving no trace
A meaningless morning begins

Don’t go
I can’t forget
In my memories I can’t

Wanting to see you
In the darkness my hand vainly reaches out into emptiness
It the night it fades away

Unable to see you
My fragile wish　gets caught in my web of memories
I can no longer breathe

Wanting to see you

Unable to see you</pre></div>

Baby join me in death
We are so young
Our lives have just begun
That's already we are considering
Escape from this world
        
And we've waited for so long
For this moment to come
Was so anxious to be together
Together in death
        
Oh oh oh
Would you die tonight for love?
Baby join me in death
Would you die?
Baby join me in death
        
Would you die tonight for love?
Baby join me in death
This world is so cruel
Placing were here only to lose
So before life tears us apart, let
Death bless me with you
        
Oh oh oh
Would you die tonight for love?
Baby join me in death
So would you die?
Baby join me in death
Would you die tonight for love?
Baby join me in death

Oh oh oh
This life ain't worth living.
Join me, join me, join me,
Join me, join me, join me

Jumping in! To the Sea Tuning out! Now

I can go on a step, for my dreams, for your dreams
I can go on a jive, for my dreams, for your dreams

I can go deep glide, for my lust, for your lust
Now, it leaves it to me
I can go deep dive, For my lust for you
I just wanna be dramatic life at all the time and with you
Now, it leaves it to me
I can go deep glide, for our destiny

Driving on! Always Bringing off! Don't hesitate
Driving on! And Carry it off! Believing on! At times Breezing on! Look on
Drifting off! And Clap your hands! To the light
I can go on a step, for my dreams, for your dreams

Lived in buried memory
With fear-ridden self-consciousness
I'm just a lone prayer

Keep running on the cold track
The hate crazed thoughts just don't stop
As if a dream awake from the dark
The world deletes all I said to you

Overwrite this pain tearing me apart
Melting
Frozen mind
Ray of light
Ready for a trip to nowhere

Overwrite this pain tearing me apart
I'm at ease
My last pray with no aim
My last... let me feel alive</pre></div>

Hey, do you know?
What appears in our eyes is dreams and illusions.
Under the grey sky, I walk, searching for you.
The words you spun, the past that was closed off –
What I hear is the sound of a single footstep.


(falling rain) The forest of destiny
(tears for you) Is a deeply sleeping memory.
The spiderweb threads are softly connected.
Before they’re reeled in,
I wonder if I’ll be able to see a gentle light.

Hey, do you know?
What echoes in my chest is the beat of the dark night.
I was listening carefully to the sound
Of the waves that approach and go back.

You who looked down, your whispered voice –
What will disappear is a fleeting wish.

(falling rain) The rainbow in the open sky
(tears for you) Is a legend that goes on forever.
The scent of flowers disappears in the rain.
I wonder if the day will come
When I accept a fate soaked in loneliness.

(falling rain) The forest of destiny
(tears for you) Is a deeply sleeping memory.
The spiderweb threads are softly connected.
Before they’re reeled in,
I wonder if I’ll be able to see a gentle light.</pre></div>

A mirage from the distance at dusk
I want to see you, I want to see you
I can't see you, I can't see you
Your Utopia
        
If we can meet in this place someday
I miss you, I miss you
I need you, I need you
Sexy, sexy
        
Hey? Why don't you come to my room?
I'll tell you a secret story
        
If you can't get going tonight
Even if I take away, there's nothing I can do
        
My heart was also wet on this dishonest night
Time cannot be turned back
Come back, come back, come back
        
A mirage from the far reaches of passion
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it
Feel-good paradise
        
If we could meet in that burning place
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it
Sexy, sexy dance
        
The stars turn pale and the flowers are in disarray
It shines brightly from the darkness
        
A mirage entangled in my fingertips
Teasing, teasing
Teasing, teasing
Let it simmer
        
I'll always be in love around here
I miss you, I miss you
I need you, I need you
Sexy, sexy you
        
Oh baby, my baby
Oh baby, oh baby
Your Utopia
        
Beyond the passion is a mirage
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it
Many times
        
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it
Sparkling

The sweet feeling of immorality
I’ll gourge myself with it till I hurl
As with this perverted sentiment will
Gnaw away at your willing new lips

Such long, thick lashes
My beloved boy too
Everything, everything!
His hair, his voice, will be mine soon

I could never think to forgive
Things like betrayal though
You lied with that tongue of yours
So I’m going to cut it off

Hey, you want to hold me, don’t you?
That’s right, everything's been a bad dream
But I’ll smash apart your past for you
So come here dear, come to me my dear

“nightmare”
”no more”

"nightmare"
"no more"</pre></div>

The words that no one speaks
About the night before
She stares off at the road
Her finger taps the door
I'd hate to judge
if roles reverse
You'd think so too
        
She'd seen the film before
But stayed until the end
She had him to herself
Perhaps as more than friends
Maybe I'd do 
things differently
If I were you

Your pulse, it races with mine
And I swear that there's no other girl
Your body shakes, it's like tonight
We can take the world
Your pulse, it races with mine
And I swear we can take the world

His hand against her cheek
Her tongue against his neck
She says, "You're awfully sweet
I feel like we connect"
Maybe it's love
How would she know?
And did she tell?

The clothes, they go on slow
She thinks of what to say
He whispers in her ear
She smiles and looks away
Her heart, it screams
She grabs his hand
And says, "Me too"

Your pulse, it races with mine
And I swear that there's no other girl
Your body shakes, it's like tonight
We can take the world
Your pulse, it races with mine
And I swear we can take the world

Is this the life, the one you imagined?
Is this the life, the one from your dreams?
Is this the life, the one you imagined?
Is this the life, the one from your dreams?

Is this the life, the one you imagined?
Is this the life, the one from your dreams?
Is this the life, the one you imagined?
Is this the life, the one from your dreams?

Your pulse, it races with mine
And I swear that there's no other girl
Your body shakes, it's like tonight
We can take the world
Your pulse, it races with mine
And I swear we can take the world</pre></div>

In the middle of a long kiss (Fu-fu) nonchalantly
you took off your necklace (Fu-fu) with fingertips
      
From friend (don't stop) zone (love me do)
Barefoot in your blue high heels     
      
Someone - Romantic - stop - Romantic
My chest, my chest is aching (is arching)
Sweetly drowning in perplexed eyes
Hold me tight - the sadness never stops    
      
Turning down the radio on the wall (Fu-fu) slovenly
I've heard it's just messing around (Fu-fu) whispering     
      
Not answering (don't stop) with words (love me do)
I'll put power into the arms holding you tonight      

Someone - Romantic - stop - Romantic
It's like, It's like my breath is ablaze
We've lived harboring the same loneliness, haven't we?
Tonight I can't sleep alone

Someone - Romantic - stop - Romantic
My chest, my chest is aching (is arching)
Back pushed by running tears
Hold me tight - the sadness - hoo! - never stops</pre></div>

You, there on the bridge
Where've you been, what's your name?
And you, there on the wall
Where will you go to, once you fall?
You, lost at sea
Do you need me, do you need directions?
Hey, put down the gun
What are you thinking?
You were someone's son

The taste of tears
The sting of pain
The smell of fear
The sounds of crying, oh

A long, long time ago, I fell to this place
From another dimension
And thrust amongst the beasts
And the way they behave, it borders on dementia
Now through all these years
I can barely take it
I don't think I can make it
Take me away from here
I want to go home
I'm so sick and tired of

The taste of tears
The sting of pain
The smell of fear
The sounds of crying, oh

As you're standing at the edge of your life
What do you remember?
Was it all you wanted?

I'm trying to earn a set of feathery wings
I wish I could protect you here
Oh, please don't cry, now, smile
As you're standing at the edge of your life
Your troubles are over
Mine are just beginning

I'm trying to earn a set of feathery wings
To take me away from here
It's me you leave behind

Oh, if only I could have been there
I'd be a hand for the sinking
If only I could have been there
I'd be a prayer for the dying
See the pain etched in my face,
Oh, I'm so sick and tired of

The taste of tears
The sting of pain
The smell of fear
The sounds of crying, oh

As you're standing at the edge of your life
What do you remember?
Was it all you wanted?

I'm trying to earn a set of feathery wings
I wish I could protect you here
Oh, please don't cry, now, smile
As you're standing at the edge of your life
Your troubles are over
Mine are just beginning

I'm trying to earn a set of feathery wings
To take me away from here
It's me you leave--

You're gone from here
Don't leave from here
Don't leave me here
I hate it here
You're gone from here
Don't leave me here
I need you here
I need to see you smile</pre></div>
