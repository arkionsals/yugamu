When I pushed my hand into the darkness ”the past” faintly swayed
Like a spider’s thread, memories softly creep up on me

The thread pulls me in and entwines my memories

A sweet fragrance is scattered about
Trembling butterflies in a spider’s web pile up beyond the mirror

Wanting to see you
In the darkness my hand vainly reaches out into emptiness
It the night it fades away

Unable to see you
My fragile wish gets caught in my web of memories
I can no longer breathe

A rose colored apparition sings in the depths of my dream
And laughs a soft beckoning laugh

I wake up with my dream leaving no trace
A meaningless morning begins

Don’t go
I can’t forget
In my memories I can’t

Wanting to see you
In the darkness my hand vainly reaches out into emptiness
It the night it fades away

Unable to see you
My fragile wish　gets caught in my web of memories
I can no longer breathe

Wanting to see you

Unable to see you</pre></div>

We are so young
Our lives have just begun
But already we are considering
To escape from this world
And we've waited, too, for so long
For this moment to come
We're so anxious to be together
Together in death, whoah-oh
        
Won't you die tonight for love?

Won't you die tonight for love?

This world is a cruel place
And we're here only to lose
So before life tears us apart let
Death bless me with you, whoa-oh

Won't you die tonight for love?
(Baby, join me in death)
Will you die?
(Baby, join me in death)
Won't you die tonight for love?
(Baby, join me in death)
Join me in death, whoa-oh

With fear-ridden self-consciousness

As if a dream awake from the dark
The world deletes all I said to you

Overwrite this pain tearing me apart
Melting
Frozen mind
Ray of light
Ready for a trip to nowhere

Overwrite this pain tearing me apart
I'm at ease
My last pray with no aim
My last... let me feel alive

Hey, do you know?
What appears in our eyes is dreams and illusions.
Under the grey sky, I walk, searching for you.
The words you spun, the past that was closed off –
What I hear is the sound of a single footstep.


(falling rain) The forest of destiny
(tears for you) Is a deeply sleeping memory.
The spiderweb threads are softly connected.
Before they’re reeled in,
I wonder if I’ll be able to see a gentle light.

Hey, do you know?
What echoes in my chest is the beat of the dark night.
I was listening carefully to the sound
Of the waves that approach and go back.

You who looked down, your whispered voice –
What will disappear is a fleeting wish.

(falling rain) The rainbow in the open sky
(tears for you) Is a legend that goes on forever.
The scent of flowers disappears in the rain.
I wonder if the day will come
When I accept a fate soaked in loneliness.

(falling rain) The forest of destiny
(tears for you) Is a deeply sleeping memory.
The spiderweb threads are softly connected.
Before they’re reeled in,
I wonder if I’ll be able to see a gentle light.</pre></div>

My heart was also wet on this dishonest night
Time cannot be turned back
Come back, come back, come back
        
A mirage from the far reaches of passion
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it
Feel-good paradise

Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it
Sexy, sexy dance

It shines brightly from the darkness
        
A mirage entangled in my fingertips
Teasing, teasing
Teasing, teasing
Let it simmer
        
I'll always be in love around here
I miss you, I miss you

Everything, everything!
His hair, his voice, will be mine soon

Things like betrayal though
You lied with that tongue of yours
So I’m going to cut it off

Hey, you want to hold me, don’t you?
That’s right, everything's been a bad dream
But I’ll smash apart your past for you
So come here dear, come to me my dear

The words that no one speaks
About the night before
She stares off at the road
Her finger taps the door
I'd hate to judge
if roles reverse
You'd think so too
        
She'd seen the film before
But stayed until the end
She had him to herself
Perhaps as more than friends
Maybe I'd do 
things differently
If I were you

Your pulse, it races with mine
And I swear that there's no other girl
Your body shakes, it's like tonight
We can take the world
Your pulse, it races with mine
And I swear we can take the world

His hand against her cheek
Her tongue against his neck
She says, "You're awfully sweet
I feel like we connect"
Maybe it's love
How would she know?
And did she tell?

The clothes, they go on slow
She thinks of what to say
He whispers in her ear
She smiles and looks away
Her heart, it screams
She grabs his hand
And says, "Me too"

Your pulse, it races with mine
And I swear that there's no other girl
Your body shakes, it's like tonight
We can take the world
Your pulse, it races with mine
And I swear we can take the world

Is this the life, the one you imagined?
Is this the life, the one from your dreams?
Is this the life, the one you imagined?
Is this the life, the one from your dreams?

Is this the life, the one you imagined?
Is this the life, the one from your dreams?
Is this the life, the one you imagined?
Is this the life, the one from your dreams?

Your pulse, it races with mine
And I swear that there's no other girl
Your body shakes, it's like tonight
We can take the world

You, there on the bridge
Where've you been, what's your name?
And you, there on the wall
Where will you go to, once you fall?
You, lost at sea
Do you need me, do you need directions?
Hey, put down the gun
What are you thinking?
You were someone's son

The taste of tears
The sting of pain
The smell of fear
The sounds of crying, oh

A long, long time ago, I fell to this place
From another dimension
And thrust amongst the beasts
And the way they behave, it borders on dementia
Now through all these years
I can barely take it
I don't think I can make it
Take me away from here
I want to go home
I'm so sick and tired of

The taste of tears
The sting of pain
The smell of fear
The sounds of crying, oh

As you're standing at the edge of your life
What do you remember?
Was it all you wanted?

I'm trying to earn a set of feathery wings
I wish I could protect you here
Oh, please don't cry, now, smile
As you're standing at the edge of your life
Your troubles are over
Mine are just beginning

I'm trying to earn a set of feathery wings
To take me away from here
It's me you leave behind

Oh, if only I could have been there
I'd be a hand for the sinking
If only I could have been there
I'd be a prayer for the dying
See the pain etched in my face,
Oh, I'm so sick and tired of

The taste of tears
The sting of pain
The smell of fear
The sounds of crying, oh

As you're standing at the edge of your life
What do you remember?
Was it all you wanted?

I'm trying to earn a set of feathery wings
I wish I could protect you here
Oh, please don't cry, now, smile
As you're standing at the edge of your life
Your troubles are over
Mine are just beginning

I'm trying to earn a set of feathery wings
To take me away from here
It's me you leave--

You're gone from here
Don't leave from here
Don't leave me here
I hate it here
You're gone from here
Don't leave me here
I need you here
I need to see you smile</pre></div>

「You got the power」

“Bashing & Mounting & Disrespect:
it’s a big invite and a usual request.
In a ill witted world without malice, I’m searching with a smile my prey.”

Just YOU who was chosen, boy
Play…no,“prey”er

One’s turn is sudden, and no one can escape from being a target.

Ward off the head wind, entwine lives.
Don’t shut yourself in loneliness, open your eyes.
A desperate anomie isn’t a metaphor of the God of Justice.
Straight in the middle of wind, without turning back.

Draw the curtains and the chain of flames: the grand finale of this tragic comedy.
「Let’s over the show」
As you face the head wind, entwine lives.
Don’t fall into loneliness, reach out.
A desperate anomie isn’t the Messiah of an Absolute Justice.
Accept the wind, and keep going relentless––

When the invisible darkness is cut, we will be flooded with dazzling light.
Let’s go together toward the unknown future.</pre></div>

      <div class="lyrics"><pre>Lyrics:

With her high heel against the wall
Kind of dancing though not at all
She had stockings running up to her thigh
Snaps her fingers to keep the time

From the back of the room I saw her there
I said she wants to be alone and I shouldn't dare
But then she noticed me glance at her
I had no choice but to dance with her

The lights that move sideways and up and down
The beat takes you over and spins you round
Our hearts steady-beating, the sweat turns to cold
We're slaves to the DJ and out of control

I watched her feet move, her hips they sway
Does a hair flip, then starts to say
"Oh my God, it's my favorite song,"
I pull her close, and she sings along

We can't slow down, even if we tried
If the record keeps spinning, so will I
She likes disco, and tastes like a tear
Tells me, don't stop dancing, and she's pulling me near

The lights that move sideways and up and down
The beat takes you over and spins you round
Our hearts steady-beating, the sweat turns to cold
We're slaves to the DJ and out of control

We've got nowhere to go, we've got nothing to prove
Instead of dancing alone I should be dancing with you
This song is turning me on, the beat is doing me in
Or maybe it's only you, but either way, let's begin

We've got nowhere to go, we've got nothing to prove
Instead of dancing alone I should be dancing with you
This song is turning me on, the beat is doing me in
Or maybe it's only you, but either way, let's begin

We've got nowhere to go, we've got nothing to prove
Instead of dancing alone I should be dancing with you
This song is turning me on, the beat is doing me in

The voice of the wind and droplets of light flow over you as you doze
I will never forget the gentle smile and the eyes you hid in sorrow
You gave me the courage to wish (even when it hurts) and to fight, so I can go on
In my dreams (even when I wake up) I will see you again

I sing, with a distant memory in my heart

You defended this fragile and fleeting world with your hands
So please, fold your wings and rest
Sheltered by an eternal peace, love through all eternity

Rest now in my arms, as I watch over you
As I recall your joy, your sorrow, and your rage
I will remember you always, until my life is exhausted

At an intersection, I heard a voice similar to yours
I turned to look up at the sky, to force back my sudden tears

I continue to walk alone, aimlessly, believing that I will see you again tomorrow (someday)
Through rainy nights (and sunny days) I wait for you

I'll never forget that dark night, we made it through

That blindingly brilliant moment when we were all together
Those precious times I didn't realize I should cherish
Now all I can do is remember, I will embrace the feeling

I know for a fact, you were there by my side
You were always always always there, smiling
If ever I lose you, I will find you, I will never leave you

You defended this fragile and fleeting world with your hands
So please, fold your wings and rest
Sheltered by an eternal peace, love through all eternity

Rest now in my arms, as I watch over you

      <div class="title">Monitoring (Best Friend Remix) - DECO*27</div>
      <div class="lyrics"><pre>Lyrics (English Translation):

Hey, guess what, I know that you're all alone "tear"ing, I'm wise to it
Twitching, your dissected heart spasms, your moans are audible
Why don't you just come clean? Secret's out anyway, are you listening?
It's normal, so normal, you know that it's totally fine, right? They just don't get it

"Hello? Hey, are you alright? I'm getting worried about you, I'm coming over now”
(DECO)

Hey, guess what, I know that you're all alone "tear"ing, I'm wise to it
Sob-sob and depressed, solitary karaoke? There's no harm in that
Let's talk all night 'til the sun comes up, doesn't mattеr if you cry some more
I'm gonna embracе you again and again
Let your tears run free, spill everything

MWAH! Please, I want you so bad
Let me take care of you, best friend, with my knack for lovin'
Will you please cry? All your hurting, I wanna hold tight
Please, say yes? I wanna show you I care, let's share our dissected hearts

MWAH! Please, I want you so bad
Let's laugh it off, hop, step, jump, and let's go!
Will you please share? It's too heavy for you, your dark thoughts
Please, say yes? I wanna stick by you and save your dissected heart

Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see
Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see
Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see
Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see
Let me see inside of you
Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see
Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see
Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see
Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see
Let me see, let me see

Hey, guess what, I know that you're all alone vexing, I'm wise to it
'Til your sob-sob sobs subside, I'll never give up on you
Hey, guess what, I know you're absolutely capable, I know it
Weakness when hurt, it's alright, you know, me, I'm always on your side
        
MWAH! Please, I want you so bad
Call my name, and anytime I'll come hither
You think you're alone? That's not true, you're not alone
That's enough now
Solo-play to dissect is finito, don't you know?

No matter how you're doing, I'll always be by your side (always)
I'll always be watching over you, see, don't be scared

MWAH! Please, I want you so bad
Let me take care of you, best friend, with my knack for lovin'
Will you please cry? All your hurting, I wanna hold tight
Please, say yes? I wanna show you I care, let's share our dissected hearts        

MWAH! Please, I want you so bad
Let's laugh it off, hop, step, jump, and let's go!
Will you please share? It's too heavy for you, your dark thoughts, I wanna sneak 'em away 'cause I'm piqued
I wanna suck dry your spice tears, save your dissected heart

Hey, guess what, I know that you're all alone "tear"ing, I'm wise to it
(Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see)
Sob-sob and depressed, solitary karaoke? There's no harm in that
(Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see, let me-- inside of you)
Together forever, doesn't matter if you cry some more
(Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see)
I'm gonna embrace you again and again
(Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see)
Let your tears run free, let out your dissected heart
(Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see)</pre></div>

      song1: { title: "deSLASH", desc: "Honestly, I don't have much reason for choosing this lyric-wise.. GOATBED's lyrics don't tend to make any sense most of the time anyways lol. But, you gotta hear me out okay. A while back this song came up on my playlist again and I instantlyyy thought of (Slasher) Yugamu. The sound of the chainsaws/drills and the moaning in the background is waaay too perfect. And <i>if</i> you wanna get into the lyrics, then <q>Grind only the same,</q> <q>Thrash out,</q> and the repetition in the song really makes me think about the whole 'Yugamu dealing with his freaky ass impulses' stuff in Slasher. Not to mention,, if you know where this song is from then you know its kinda got to do with falling into <q>animalistic urges</q> (Ren's bad ending still haunts me) lol. Anyways, I really wanted to start the playlist off with this song even if it's one of the more non substantial choices.. I'm sorry. I just really love the dmmd soundtrack." , file: "y2mate.com - DRAMAtical Murder OST  deSLASH.mp3", image: "ui_event_screen_00498_00_04.png"},
      song10: { title: "Arachne", desc: "Ahh, there’s so much I could say about this one,,, but I’ll try to keep it relatively short. I absolutely <i>adore</i> Kaya, and while listening through his discography recently, Yugamu came to mind. I heavily associate Yugamu with spiders, so Arachne felt really perfect. I also thought the mix of gentleness and eeriness in the song suited him well... But when I went back to refresh myself on the lyrics, I was like, 'wow this fits even better than I thought'. It really reminds me of day 56 of Second Scenario and the girl from Yugamu's memories. I won’t dive too deep but <q>wanting to see you,</q> <q>unable to see you,</q> <q>my fragile wish gets caught in my web of memories, I can no longer breathe,</q> oughhh he was genuinely so desperate to just hear from her and I feel like we don’t talk about that enough.. tbf his boobs were very distracting but oughh day 56 means so fucking much to me. My Yugamu..", file: "y2mate--Arachne.mp3", image: "secondscen.png" },
      song6: { title: "Join Me in Death", desc: "There was NO way I was going to make a Yugamu playlist without adding Join Me in Death. Considering his whole suicidal romantic-mutual-murder wish to escape from his life, the choice is pretty self explanatory. Personally, I see it tying back to the girl from his memories (or maybe even Takumi),,, but you can connect it to whoever you want. Overall the song is just very Yugamu, same could probaby be said about most HIM songs tbh", file: "y2mate--Join-Me-In-Death.mp3", image: "joinme.png" },
      song2: { title: "Dramatique?", desc: "Another song from dmmd..sorry. Well, it’s not exactly from the soundtrack, but it was used in promotional videos for it, so I'm counting it. I just think Yugamu fits the general vibe of dmmd, if that makes sense. Maybe it’s just my crazy autism for dmmd (it’s my favorite piece of media ever), but Aonoi (I’m an Aoba seme truther sorry not sorry) and Sumikage feel really similar to me. It might be because I find Takumi and Aoba very 'each other coded', and Yugamu with his mountain of trauma and emotional baggage, makes a perfect dmmd love interest lol. So,, I can’t help but keep adding dmmd songs… Anyways, I specifically have KG Yugamu in mind with this. <q>Strongly Changing it! The Future,</q> <q>Clap your hands! Toward the Future,</q> <q>for my dreams, for your dreams,</q> <q>for my lust, for your lust,</q> <q>I just wanna be dramatic life at all the time and with you</q> (Honestly, the whole song really) makes me think about Yugamu wanting to work toward the KG polycule’s dream of living together as roommates in the future. I have my (many) gripes with the route, but aughh it’s still very dear to me. And 'Dramatique?' is certainly a way to describe him lol.. my performative freak Yugamu Omokage...", file: "y2mate.com - DRAMAtical Murder OST  Dramatique.mp3", image: "dramatique.png" },
      song3: { title: "A Lone Prayer", desc: `Kind of a wild pull,, but this song was another case where as soon as I heard it again my mind went straight to (Second Scenario) Yugamu, specifically after everyone finds out the truth on day 67. "The world deletes all I said to you," "Overwrite this pain tearing me apart," "let me feel alive," the last line especially,, it makes me think of day 72 when he joins the fight and goes "I need to go on a spree just so I can feel something! I pretty much don't care who I kill right now!" ..I love Yugamu. Also I had to shorten this specific explanation so much because for some reason it kept breaking my whole code and I could NOT for the life of me figure out why.. bro I'm being silenced. So just pretend I wrote something super intellectual about Yugamu's initial reaction of like,, devastation and disbelief, to lowkey manic, and then turning out to be the one happiest about the truth.. oughh his 6th bonding event`, file: "A Lone Prayer - Persona 1 (PSP).mp3", image: "chest.png" },
      song4: { title: "Rain Tears", desc: `Rain tears... it's sung/performed by Ruri Hijibe in Durarara!!×2. If you've never watched or don't know who she is, I recommend skimming through her wiki, but here's a short summary: she's a part vampire, makeup artist and pop idol with really fuckass hair, and brutal serial killer who actually doesnt enjoy killing at all,,, lol I think you can see where im going with this.. Yugamu kind of reminds me of her in a way? (Also there's this one scene I reallyyy wanna redraw as Sumikage or Gakugamu and I'm forcing you to look at it: <a href="rurikasa.png">image</a>) but anyways the song also makes me think of the girl from Yugamu's memories (yes again) and Second Scenario (after finding out the truth). Also the sublte spider symbolism was calling out to me. I've said it before on main but I'll say it again here YUGAMU IS SO SPIDER CODED HE'S SO SPIDER PLEASEPLEASE PLEASE DOES ANYONE UNDERSTAND ME.. I'm not done yet though yeah sorry I've got more. I also kinda see it as Kg Yugamu, specifically in the beginning when the invader hunt first begins and he's barely teaming up with Takumi. But honestly I have no idea how to explain that.. I think my mind just makes some bullshit connections sometimes`, file: "04 rain tears.mp3", image: "prince.png" },
      song5: { title: "Sexy Sexy,", desc: "ANOTHER WILD CHOICE I'M SORRYYY!!!! I really don't have any reasoning for this one either which just makes it worse,, ITS KIND OF JUST? THE VIBE? The song is a good mix of funky and sexy and I think thats very Yugamu plus the like,, desperation in the song was very Cult of Takumi Yugamu to me lol.. Also I'd like to imagine that Yugamu's singing would have a similar sound to this.. ", file: "Gakkou no Kaidan End - Sexy Sexy (Full).mp3", image: "cot.png"},
      song7: { title: "Succubus", desc: `If you know Kaya then obviously I had to include a Schwarz Stein song too and here it is AUGHH THERE'S SO MUCH I WANNA SAY BUT I DONT KNOW HOW TO WORD ITTTT again, the vibe is just very Yugamu and by the first verse I was already putting it onto the playlist. The whole thing is super Yugamu but listening to it freshly after Mystery route had me tweaking the fuck out, "I could never think to forgive things like betrayal though"...does anyone else also think about Dance in the Purple Flames daily *gets shot* I miss you my Sumikage... "Hey, you want to hold me, don't you? That's right, everything's been a bad dream. But I'll smash apart your past for you. So come here dear, come to me my dear." Both of them hoping just as much as the other that it wasn't true and that Takumi wasn't the killer.. the fact Yugamu didn't even actually intend to kill Takumi???? I'm sorry Dance in the Purple Flames is just so insane to me,, Mystery route might've been a total letdown but this ending means everything to me. Also can we talk about the way Yugamu reacts to betrayal? Like this isn't even the first time he's reacted so impulsively to it, I really love that in Coming of Age he was actually on the opposing side to Takumi..`, file: "Schwarz Stein - Succubus - HimeAsagi.mp3", image: "dance.png" },
