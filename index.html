When I pushed my hand into the darkness ”the past” faintly swayed
Like a spider’s thread, memories softly creep up on me

The thread pulls me in and entwines my memories

A sweet fragrance is scattered about
Trembling butterflies in a spider’s web pile up beyond the mirror

Wanting to see you
In the darkness my hand vainly reaches out into emptiness
It the night it fades away

Unable to see you
My fragile wish gets caught in my web of memories
I can no longer breathe

A rose colored apparition sings in the depths of my dream
And laughs a soft beckoning laugh

I wake up with my dream leaving no trace
A meaningless morning begins

Don’t go
I can’t forget
In my memories I can’t

Wanting to see you
In the darkness my hand vainly reaches out into emptiness
It the night it fades away

Unable to see you
My fragile wish　gets caught in my web of memories
I can no longer breathe

Wanting to see you

Unable to see you</pre></div>

We are so young
Our lives have just begun
But already we are considering
To escape from this world
And we've waited, too, for so long
For this moment to come
We're so anxious to be together
Together in death, whoah-oh
        
Won't you die tonight for love?
(Baby, join me in death)
Won't you die?
(Baby, join me in death)
Won't you die tonight for love?
(Baby, join me in death)
        
This world is a cruel place
And we're here only to lose
So before life tears us apart let
Death bless me with you, whoa-oh

Won't you die tonight for love?
(Baby, join me in death)
Will you die?
(Baby, join me in death)
Won't you die tonight for love?
(Baby, join me in death)
Join me in death, whoa-oh 
        
This life ain't worth living
This life, it ain't worth living 
(Join me, join me, join me,)
This life, it ain't worth living.         
(Join me, join me, join me)
This life ain't worth living
        
Won't you die tonight for love?

So would you die?

Won't you die tonight for love?

Lived in buried memory
With fear-ridden self-consciousness
I'm just a lone prayer

Keep running on the cold track
The hate crazed thoughts just don't stop
As if a dream awake from the dark
The world deletes all I said to you

Overwrite this pain tearing me apart
Melting
Frozen mind
Ray of light
Ready for a trip to nowhere

Overwrite this pain tearing me apart
I'm at ease
My last pray with no aim
My last... let me feel alive
      
Lived in buried memory
With fear-ridden self-consciousness
I'm just a lone prayer

Hey, do you know?
What appears in our eyes is dreams and illusions.
Under the grey sky, I walk, searching for you.
The words you spun, the past that was closed off –
What I hear is the sound of a single footstep.


(falling rain) The forest of destiny
(tears for you) Is a deeply sleeping memory.
The spiderweb threads are softly connected.
Before they’re reeled in,
I wonder if I’ll be able to see a gentle light.

Hey, do you know?
What echoes in my chest is the beat of the dark night.
I was listening carefully to the sound
Of the waves that approach and go back.

You who looked down, your whispered voice –
What will disappear is a fleeting wish.

(falling rain) The rainbow in the open sky
(tears for you) Is a legend that goes on forever.
The scent of flowers disappears in the rain.
I wonder if the day will come
When I accept a fate soaked in loneliness.

(falling rain) The forest of destiny
(tears for you) Is a deeply sleeping memory.
The spiderweb threads are softly connected.
Before they’re reeled in,
I wonder if I’ll be able to see a gentle light.</pre></div>

A mirage from the distance at dusk
I want to see you, I want to see you
I can't see you, I can't see you
Your Utopia
        
If we can meet in this place someday
I miss you, I miss you
I need you, I need you
Sexy, sexy
        
Hey? Why don't you come to my room?
I'll tell you a secret story
        
If you can't get going tonight
Even if I take away, there's nothing I can do
        
My heart was also wet on this dishonest night
Time cannot be turned back
Come back, come back, come back
        
A mirage from the far reaches of passion
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it
Feel-good paradise
        
If we could meet in that burning place
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it
Sexy, sexy dance
        
The stars turn pale and the flowers are in disarray
It shines brightly from the darkness
        
A mirage entangled in my fingertips
Teasing, teasing
Teasing, teasing
Let it simmer
        
I'll always be in love around here
I miss you, I miss you
I need you, I need you
Sexy, sexy you
        
Oh baby, my baby
Oh baby, oh baby
Your Utopia
        
Beyond the passion is a mirage
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it
Many times
        
Shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it

The sweet feeling of immorality
I’ll gourge myself with it till I hurl
As with this perverted sentiment will
Gnaw away at your willing new lips

Such long, thick lashes
My beloved boy too
Everything, everything!
His hair, his voice, will be mine soon

I could never think to forgive
Things like betrayal though
You lied with that tongue of yours
So I’m going to cut it off

Hey, you want to hold me, don’t you?
That’s right, everything's been a bad dream
But I’ll smash apart your past for you
So come here dear, come to me my dear

“nightmare”
”no more”

"nightmare"

The words that no one speaks
About the night before
She stares off at the road
Her finger taps the door
I'd hate to judge
if roles reverse
You'd think so too
        
She'd seen the film before
But stayed until the end
She had him to herself
Perhaps as more than friends
Maybe I'd do 
things differently
If I were you

Your pulse, it races with mine
And I swear that there's no other girl
Your body shakes, it's like tonight
We can take the world
Your pulse, it races with mine
And I swear we can take the world

His hand against her cheek
Her tongue against his neck
She says, "You're awfully sweet
I feel like we connect"
Maybe it's love
How would she know?
And did she tell?

The clothes, they go on slow
She thinks of what to say
He whispers in her ear
She smiles and looks away
Her heart, it screams
She grabs his hand
And says, "Me too"

Your pulse, it races with mine
And I swear that there's no other girl
Your body shakes, it's like tonight
We can take the world
Your pulse, it races with mine
And I swear we can take the world

Is this the life, the one you imagined?
Is this the life, the one from your dreams?
Is this the life, the one you imagined?
Is this the life, the one from your dreams?

Is this the life, the one you imagined?
Is this the life, the one from your dreams?
Is this the life, the one you imagined?
Is this the life, the one from your dreams?

Your pulse, it races with mine
And I swear that there's no other girl
Your body shakes, it's like tonight
We can take the world
Your pulse, it races with mine
And I swear we can take the world</pre></div>

In the middle of a long kiss (Fu-fu) nonchalantly

You, there on the bridge
Where've you been, what's your name?
And you, there on the wall
Where will you go to, once you fall?
You, lost at sea
Do you need me, do you need directions?
Hey, put down the gun
What are you thinking?
You were someone's son

The taste of tears
The sting of pain
The smell of fear
The sounds of crying, oh

A long, long time ago, I fell to this place
From another dimension
And thrust amongst the beasts
And the way they behave, it borders on dementia
Now through all these years
I can barely take it
I don't think I can make it
Take me away from here
I want to go home
I'm so sick and tired of

The taste of tears
The sting of pain
The smell of fear
The sounds of crying, oh

As you're standing at the edge of your life
What do you remember?
Was it all you wanted?

I'm trying to earn a set of feathery wings
I wish I could protect you here
Oh, please don't cry, now, smile
As you're standing at the edge of your life
Your troubles are over
Mine are just beginning

I'm trying to earn a set of feathery wings
To take me away from here
It's me you leave behind

Oh, if only I could have been there
I'd be a hand for the sinking
If only I could have been there
I'd be a prayer for the dying
See the pain etched in my face,
Oh, I'm so sick and tired of

The taste of tears
The sting of pain
The smell of fear
The sounds of crying, oh

As you're standing at the edge of your life
What do you remember?
Was it all you wanted?

I'm trying to earn a set of feathery wings
I wish I could protect you here
Oh, please don't cry, now, smile
As you're standing at the edge of your life
Your troubles are over
Mine are just beginning

I'm trying to earn a set of feathery wings
To take me away from here
It's me you leave--

You're gone from here
Don't leave from here
Don't leave me here
I hate it here
You're gone from here
Don't leave me here
I need you here
I need to see you smile</pre></div>

This is not the way into my heart, into my head
Into my brain, into none of the above
This is just my way of unleashing the feelings deep inside of me
This spark of black that I seem to love

We can get a little crazy just for fun, just for fun
Don't even try to hold it back, just let go
Tie me up and take me over till you're done, 'til I'm done
You got me feening and I'm ready to blow

Push up to my body, sink your teeth into my flesh
(Get undressed, t-taste the flesh)
Bite into me harder, sink your teeth into my flesh
(Pass the test, t-taste the flesh)

Hold me up against the wall
Give it 'til I beg, give me some more
Make me bleed, I like it rough
Like it rough, rough, rough

Push up to my body, sink your teeth into my flesh

Hold my hands above my head and push my face into the bed
'Cause I'm a screamer baby, make me a mute
You put your hand upon my neck and feel the pulse beat-beat-beat-beat
It's like a trigger getting ready to shoot

Wanna wrestle with me baby, here's a sneak little peak
You can dominate the game 'cause I'm tough
I don't play around that often, when I do, I'm a freak
So you'd better believe I like it rough

Push up to my body, sink your teeth into my flesh
(Get undressed, t-taste the flesh)
Bite into me harder, sink your teeth into my flesh
(Pass the test, t-taste the flesh)

Hold me up against the wall
Give it 'til I beg, give me some more
Make me bleed, I like it rough
Like it rough, rough, rough

Push up to my body, sink your teeth into my flesh

Hold me down and make me scream
Lay me on the floor
Turn me on and take me out
Make me beg for more

Push up to my body, sink your teeth into my flesh
(Get undressed, t-taste the flesh)
Bite into me harder, sink your teeth into my flesh
(Pass the test, t-taste the flesh)

Hold me up against the wall
Give it 'til I beg, give me some more
Make me bleed, I like it rough
Like it rough, rough, rough

Push up to my body, sink your teeth into my flesh

Push up to my body, sink your teeth into my flesh
(Get undressed, t-taste the flesh)
Bite into me harder, sink your teeth into my flesh
(Pass the test, t-taste the flesh)

Hold me up against the wall
Give it 'til I beg, give me some more
Make me bleed, I like it rough
Like it rough, rough, rough

Push up to my body, sink your teeth into my flesh

Push up to my body, sink your teeth into my flesh

Bite into me harder, sink your teeth into my flesh

The voice of the wind and droplets of light flow over you as you doze
I will never forget the gentle smile and the eyes you hid in sorrow
You gave me the courage to wish (even when it hurts) and to fight, so I can go on
In my dreams (even when I wake up) I will see you again

I sing, with a distant memory in my heart

You defended this fragile and fleeting world with your hands
So please, fold your wings and rest
Sheltered by an eternal peace, love through all eternity

Rest now in my arms, as I watch over you
As I recall your joy, your sorrow, and your rage
I will remember you always, until my life is exhausted

At an intersection, I heard a voice similar to yours
I turned to look up at the sky, to force back my sudden tears

I continue to walk alone, aimlessly, believing that I will see you again tomorrow (someday)
Through rainy nights (and sunny days) I wait for you

I'll never forget that dark night, we made it through

That blindingly brilliant moment when we were all together
Those precious times I didn't realize I should cherish
Now all I can do is remember, I will embrace the feeling

I know for a fact, you were there by my side
You were always always always there, smiling
If ever I lose you, I will find you, I will never leave you

You defended this fragile and fleeting world with your hands
So please, fold your wings and rest
Sheltered by an eternal peace, love through all eternity

Rest now in my arms, as I watch over you

I will remember you always, until my life is exhausted

That blindingly brilliant moment when we were all together

It's normal, so normal, you know that it's totally fine, right? They just don't get it

"Hello? Hey, are you alright? I'm getting worried about you, I'm coming over now”
(DECO)

Hey, guess what, I know that you're all alone "tear"ing, I'm wise to it
Sob-sob and depressed, solitary karaoke? There's no harm in that
Let's talk all night 'til the sun comes up, doesn't mattеr if you cry some more
I'm gonna embracе you again and again
Let your tears run free, spill everything

MWAH! Please, I want you so bad
Let me take care of you, best friend, with my knack for lovin'
Will you please cry? All your hurting, I wanna hold tight
Please, say yes? I wanna show you I care, let's share our dissected hearts

MWAH! Please, I want you so bad
Let's laugh it off, hop, step, jump, and let's go!
Will you please share? It's too heavy for you, your dark thoughts
Please, say yes? I wanna stick by you and save your dissected heart

Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see
Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see
Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see
Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see
Let me see inside of you
Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see
Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see
Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see
Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see
Let me see, let me see

Hey, guess what, I know that you're all alone vexing, I'm wise to it
'Til your sob-sob sobs subside, I'll never give up on you
Hey, guess what, I know you're absolutely capable, I know it
Weakness when hurt, it's alright, you know, me, I'm always on your side
        
MWAH! Please, I want you so bad
Call my name, and anytime I'll come hither
You think you're alone? That's not true, you're not alone
That's enough now
Solo-play to dissect is finito, don't you know?

No matter how you're doing, I'll always be by your side (always)
I'll always be watching over you, see, don't be scared

MWAH! Please, I want you so bad
Let me take care of you, best friend, with my knack for lovin'
Will you please cry? All your hurting, I wanna hold tight
Please, say yes? I wanna show you I care, let's share our dissected hearts        

MWAH! Please, I want you so bad
Let's laugh it off, hop, step, jump, and let's go!
Will you please share? It's too heavy for you, your dark thoughts, I wanna sneak 'em away 'cause I'm piqued
I wanna suck dry your spice tears, save your dissected heart

Hey, guess what, I know that you're all alone "tear"ing, I'm wise to it
(Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see)
Sob-sob and depressed, solitary karaoke? There's no harm in that
(Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see, let me-- inside of you)
Together forever, doesn't matter if you cry some more
(Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see)
I'm gonna embrace you again and again
(Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see)
Let your tears run free, let out your dissected heart
(Let me see, let me see, let me see, let me see)</pre></div>

      song1: { title: "deSLASH", desc: "Honestly, I don't have much reason for choosing this lyric-wise. GOATBED's lyrics don't tend make any sense most of the time anyways lol. But, you gotta hear me out okay. A while back this song came up on my playlist again and I instantlyyy thought of (Slasher) Yugamu. The sound of the chainsaws/drills and the moaning in the background is waaay too perfect. And <i>if</i> you wanna get into the lyrics, then <q>Grind only the same</q>, <q>Thrash out</q>, and the repetition in the song really makes me think about the whole 'Yugamu dealing with his freaky ass impulses' stuff in Slasher. Not to mention,, if you know where this song is from then you know its kinda got to do with falling into <q>animalistic urges</q> (Ren's bad ending still haunts me) lol. Anyways, I really wanted to start the playlist off with this song even if it's one of the more non substantial choices.. I'm sorry. I just really love the dmmd soundtrack." , file: "y2mate.com - DRAMAtical Murder OST  deSLASH.mp3", image: "ui_event_screen_00498_00_04.png"},
      song10: { title: "Arachne", desc: "Ahh, there’s so much I could say about this one,,, but I’ll try to keep it relatively short. I absolutely <i>adore</i> Kaya, and while listening through his discography recently, Yugamu instantly came to mind. I heavily associate Yugamu with spiders, so Arachne felt really perfect. I also thought the mix of gentleness and eeriness in the song suited him well... But when I went back to refresh myself on the lyrics, I was like, 'wow this fits even better than I thought'. It really reminds me of day 56 of Second Scenario and the girl from Yugamu's memories. I won’t dive too deep but <q>wanting to see you</q>, <q>unable to see you</q>, <q>my fragile wish gets caught in my web of memories, I can no longer breathe</q> oughhh he was genuinely so desperate to just hear from her and I feel like we don’t talk about that enough.. tbf his boobs were very distracting but oughh day 56 means so fucking much to me. My Yugamu..", file: "y2mate--Arachne.mp3", image: "secondscen.png" },
      song6: { title: "Join Me in Death", desc: "There was NO way I was going to make a Yugamu playlist without adding Join Me in Death. Considering his whole suicidal romantic-mutual-murder wish to escape from his life, my reason for choosing it is pretty self explanatory (even with the song title alone lol). Personally, I see it tying back to the girl from his memories (or maybe even Takumi),,, but you could probably connect it to whoever you want. Overall the song is just very Yugamu, lowkey most HIM songs are.. go give them a listen", file: "y2mate--Join-Me-In-Death.mp3", image: "joinme.png" },
      song2: { title: "Dramatique?", desc: "Another song from dmmd..sorry. Well, it’s not exactly from the soundtrack, but it was used in promotional videos for it, I'm counting it. Moving on,, I just think Yugamu fits the general vibe of dmmd, if that makes sense. Maybe it’s just my crazy autism for dmmd (it’s my favorite piece of media ever,, for better or worse), but Aonoi (I’m an Aoba seme truther sorry not sorry) and Sumikage just feel really similar to me. It might be because I find Takumi and Aoba very 'each other coded', and Yugamu with his mountain of trauma and baggage, makes a perfect dmmd love interest lol. So with all this,, I can’t help but keep adding dmmd songs… Anyways, I specifically have KG Yugamu in mind with this. <q>Strongly Changing it! The Future</q>, <q>Clap your hands! Toward the Future</q>, <q>for my dreams, for your dreams</q>, <q>for my lust, for your lust</q>, <q>I just wanna be dramatic life at all the time and with you</q> (Honestly, the whole song really) makes me think about Yugamu wanting to work toward the KG polycule’s dream of living together as roommates in the future. I have my (many) gripes with the route, but aughh it’s still very dear to me. And 'Dramatique?' is certainly a way to describe him lol.. my performative freak Yugamu Omokage...", file: "y2mate.com - DRAMAtical Murder OST  Dramatique.mp3", image: "dramatique.png" },
      song3: { title: "A Lone Prayer", desc: "This song was kind of a wild pull,,, but it was another case where as soon as I heard it my mind jumped straight to (Second Scenario) Yugamu again, specifically after everyone finds out the truth on Day 67. His reaction was the most interesting to me of the whole cast.. He was so desperate to reach that girl that he’s willing to perform self surgery, drug his own teamates, and even crucify Sirei (lol),, then when the truth is revealed, he shifts into this sort of?? almost calm?? devastated disbelief?? followed by full on manic. And after, he honestly seems to end up being the happiest one about it.. <q>I can be whatever I want… That’s not a bad feeling at all.</q> But when I think of this song, I think more about the devastation into mania part lol,, <q>The world deletes all I said to you</q>, <q>Overwrite this pain tearing me apart</q>, <q>let me feel alive</q> the last line especially,,, it makes me think of Day 72 when he joins the fight and goes <q>I need to go on a spree just so I can feel something! I pretty much don't care who I kill right now!</q> ..I love Yugamu", file: "A Lone Prayer - Persona 1 (PSP).mp3", image: "chest.png" },
